Who reads those text log files anyway? Get your log output inserted into JIRA!

This project aims at creating a simple C# client on top of the JIRA SOAP service as well as a log4net appender for JIRA, making it easy for your application to create issues in JIRA. 

Creating an issue with attachments is as easy as:
new IssueBuilder()
   .Project("TST")
   .Summary("A summary")
   .Description("A description")
   .Attachment("application.log", "base64encoded binary")
   .Attachment("access.log", "base64encoded binary")
   .Create();
